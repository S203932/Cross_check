The idea is to use the NHL data set of players, but look for their appearance in Movies and Tv.
https://www.nhl.com/stats/ is used to get information about current and former players. 
Then an api like https://www.omdbapi.com/, https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/person-movie-credits or similar is used to gather information about each person to populate the database. 
This would create a database capable of answering questions such as "which players appear in television?", "what years contained the most appearances of NHL players in movies?" and "which players have appeared tv shows and movies"?
