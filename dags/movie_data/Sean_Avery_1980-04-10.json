Although that was enough to get him into the Montreal Canadiens, his frequent injuries cost him the confidence of his team and the fans. In the face of these doubts, Richard eventually shows the kind of aggressive and skillful play that would make him one of the greatest players of all time as \"The Rocket.\" However for all his success, Richard and his fellow French Canadians face constant discrimination in a league dominated by the English speaking. Although a man of few words, Richard begins to speak his own mind about the injustice which creates a organizational conflict that would culminate in his infamous 1955 season suspension that sparks an ethnic riot in protest. In the face of these challenges, Richard must decide who exactly is he playing for.", "popularity": 9.99, "poster_path": "/uH55rXL4ad8TEm0vtlsFtXhZwKv.jpg", "release_date": "2005-10-25", "title": "The Rocket", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 44, "character": "Bob Dill", "credit_id": "52fe4785c3a36847f813a423", "order": 8}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/yY76zq9XSuJ4nWyPDuwkdV7Wt0c.jpg", "genre_ids": [28, 53, 878], "id": 577922, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Tenet", "overview": "Armed with only one word - Tenet - and fighting for the survival of the entire world, the Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.", "popularity": 62.656, "poster_path": "/aCIFMriQh8rvhxpN1IWGgvH0Tlg.jpg", "release_date": "2020-08-22", "title": "Tenet", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.185, "vote_count": 9960, "character": "Red Soldier 1", "credit_id": "64ba69b4ab6849011c076ddc", "order": 36}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/h0TuquPlfxqe4sJSy7sUlEzaAsL.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 36], "id": 872585, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Oppenheimer", "overview": "The story of J.
