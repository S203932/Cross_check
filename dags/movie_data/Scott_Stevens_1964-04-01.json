How did they assemble a team to beat Canada, who had previously won 4/5 Canada Cup tournaments? The documentary itself is a fun look back at a tournament that had a ton of drama despite not getting much in the way of publicity, especially in the United States. The movie covers Team USA\u2019s creation and all of the international background going into the World Cup. The US was 0-7 against Canada in previous Canada Cup tournaments and hadn\u2019t beaten their northern rivals in 20 years. A first shift brawl in a round robin game against Canada foreshadowed how the Americans would play for the rest of the tournament.", "popularity": 0.486, "poster_path": "/d3TxCUCsZIsg796Su3QCy001MA6.jpg", "release_date": "2016-09-14", "title": "Orchestrating An Upset: The 1996 World Cup of Hockey", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "64ee4235caa508012b05391a", "order": 7, "media_type": "movie"}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 476303, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "New Jersey Devils Stanley Cup 2002-2003 Champions", "overview": "Chronicles the latest chapter of the Devils\u2019 third Championship in nine years", "popularity": 0.388, "poster_path": "/1KsNlq3wwIo5jUYyaR9S5KFoB3a.jpg", "release_date": "2003-07-01", "title": "New Jersey Devils Stanley Cup 2002-2003 Champions", "video": true, "vote_average": 4.7, "vote_count": 3, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "650f7402a3e4ba00abeec0cb", "order": 3, "media_type": "movie"}], "crew": [], "id": 4241646}
