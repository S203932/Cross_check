Disciplines given prominence here include speed skating, figure skating, aerial skiing, curling, and the biathlon. Training is analysed as much as the competitions themselves. A suite of accidents and mishaps, and the consequent tears of frustration, remind us that the Olympics is not just about winning.", "popularity": 0.605, "poster_path": "/xqa10oSjAfBcePGAOQR12mvOXKa.jpg", "release_date": "2016-06-16", "title": "Rings of the World", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "character": "", "credit_id": "61a08e80dcb6a3002d238197", "order": 2}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/iIkc32njg5KlIcxgFaaKW52tGn0.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 1125845, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Open Heart", "overview": "An intimate profile of New York Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist's struggles to return to hockey after heart surgery.", "popularity": 1.106, "poster_path": "/w1tIdLWOVmLaGmIKHCH6hQzE1tU.jpg", "release_date": "2023-06-15", "title": "Open Heart", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 1, "character": "Self", "credit_id": "645dc24c9590e301695e06e0", "order": 0}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/bIv9t4kJoljq9aSHFBKZEs7owMe.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 1047024, "original_language": "sv", "original_title": "Henrik Lundqvist - en hockeysaga", "overview": "Marie Lehmann has followed Henrik Lundqvist throughout his entire NHL career giving us a unique look into his life as King Henrik in New York.", "popularity": 0.298, "poster_path": "/is3uiyPLCsXEEnpJXy51xlX40FI.jpg", "release_date": "2022-11-10", "title": "The King of New York - An Ice Hockey Saga", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "character": "Self", "credit_id": "636e1566ca4f6700bbbf0072", "order": 0}], "crew": [], "id": 2429182}
